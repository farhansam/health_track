# 1. Background
Health Track is an interactive website targeted towards users who are health-conscious. The website allows the users to find out their BMI based on their height and weight, their recommended daily calorie intake based on their age and level of activeness, monitor their calorie intake for the day, and also suggest to them some dishes that they can prepare themselves and consume based on their recommended daily calorie intake. The website will be able to assist the users in their journey to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
